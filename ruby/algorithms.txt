Release 1: DOING THE DISHES

- Count how many items are sitting in the sink. Store this value as DIRTY DISHES.

- If there are more than three DIRTY DISHES:
	- Shriek "It's time to do the dishes!"
	- Turn on the faucet to HOT.
	- Squirt a liberal dose of anti-bacterial dish soap onto all of the DIRTY DISHES.
	- Splash a small amount of HOT water onto all DIRTY DISHES.
- Else:
	- Resume browsing reddit.

- While there are any DIRTY DISHES remaining:
	- Hold the top-most dirty dish with the left hand.
	- Hold sponge under faucet with the right hand.
	- Squeeze and relax sponge to draw in HOT tap water. This serves to (1) replenish moisture and get rid of residue.		- While a given dirty dish is dirty and until it is clean:
		- Scrub in a circular motion with the now wet sponge, generating foam from dish soap and loosening food matter.
	- Rinse the dish under the hot water until completely free of soapy foam and now loosened food matter.
	- Place the dish in hand to the side of the sink, starting or otherwise adding to a growing area next to the sink for CLEAN DISHES to dry!
	- Pat self on the back and take note that there is now one less DIRTY DISH!

- If there are no more DIRTY DISHES:
	- While there is any residual food matter: 
		- Use the sponge to push it toward the drain.
	- Rinse the sponge under the tap, squeeze it out until dry, and place it next to the sink. 
	- Wash off your hands of any remaining soap or food matter.
	- Dry your hands.
	- Turn off the faucet.

- While there are CLEAN DISHES sitting next to the sink:
	- Pick up the nearest CLEAN DISH.
	- Grab a dry and clean towel with the other hand.
	- Dry in a circular motion until there is no more moisture.
	- Place the dish in the cupboard.
	- Pat self on the back and take note that there is now one less CLEAN DISH to dry!

- If there are no more CLEAN DISHES sitting next to the sink and waiting to be dried and stored in the cupboard:
	- Celebrate!
	- Return to browsing reddit!

What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
	
	A: Semantic tags are helpful labels that describe the type of content they contain. This makes it easy for people unfamiliar with a website to quickly pick up its code, understand structure, and make edits without too much headscratching about what goes where in a disorganized sea of text. 



What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
	
	A: The browser will read the page from top to bottom, recognizing the tags which tell the computer the page is in HTML first. It will then work down the page, rendering elements.


What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
	
	A: In this challenge, we learned to create and employ snippets of reusable code (as well as how to modify multiple similar elements using command d). I will create snippets at a later date, but for now I need to practice basic syntax and thinking through the code -- having to write things out the old fashioned way is helpful review.


What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
	
	A: The most difficult piece of this challenge was grasping the subtly different applications for the various semantic tags. I am sure it will make more sense as I build more complex pages that make use of these organizational tools.

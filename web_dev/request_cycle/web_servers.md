1.   What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
	Linux is designed around keeping users "free" to use a very wide range of tools. 


2.  In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
	A VPS is a hosted virtual computer hosted in a datacenter. It runs an operating system, can have suitable software installed on it, etc. An account with a service provider could be a cost effective alternative for a company to running its own datacenter. 

3.  Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
	Linux (and other UNIX-like OS) rely on privilege separation to allow many people to use one computer at once. Most users are unable to modify the system, only operate it --- except the root user who is something of an admin. This root user can do anything on the system without restrictions, which means they could accidentally refigure it and make it unworkable for everyone.

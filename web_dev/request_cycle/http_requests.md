1.  What are some common HTTP status codes?
	404 Not Found: requested a page that is no longer there. 
	403 Forbidden: access is blocked (ex: user not on whitelist)


2.  What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?
	With GET methods, all data for a form is encoded into the URL where with POST this form data appears in the body of the HTTP request.


3.  Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?
	An HTTP cookie is user data regarding behavior on a particular website etc stored in the user's browser. This allows the browser to 'remember' things like usernames, shopping carts, browsing history, etc.

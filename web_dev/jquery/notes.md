1.  Already did some googling on JQuery (had previously opened 9.3 to see what it was, now just jamming to get stuff done before starting intensive portion of course.)

2.  Spent some time on codeacademy learning the basics and comparing it to what I learned during DBC's JS lessons and intro to JS in school.

3.  I learn rules/syntax best by doing, e.g. challenges on codewars, codeacademy, or playing around in console / repl. Going to experiment.
